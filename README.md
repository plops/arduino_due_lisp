# Purpose and Scope

This repository implements a multi-camera coherent imaging system for characterizing multimode optical fibers through holographic measurements. The system synchronizes three Basler GigE cameras using an Arduino Due microcontroller to capture spatially and angularly resolved interference patterns, performs real-time Fourier transform processing, and conducts offline statistical analysis on multi-dimensional datasets.

# Camera Acquisition System

The system supports three Basler GigE cameras capturing synchronized images for holographic fiber characterization experiments. Multiple acquisition paths coexist to serve different purposes: the primary real-time system using the proprietary camera SDK with X11 visualization, alternative scanning patterns, an open-source Aravis-based alternative, and C++ implementations for performance testing.


# Image Processing

The image processing subsystem provides array manipulation, format conversion, and mathematical operations for processing camera data in real-time and preparing it for FFT analysis and storage. This page covers the Common Lisp image processing utilities found in the image-processing package. 

The Julia-based offline analysis pipeline that processes multi-dimensional ICS files generated by the camera acquisition systems. The scripts perform compute-intensive post-processing operations including endface reconstruction, angular throughput analysis, Pearson correlation mapping, and SVD decomposition. 

# Hardware Control

This page documents the hardware control subsystem that manages the Arduino Due for camera synchronization and Fast Steering Mirror positioning. The Arduino Due runs a FemtoLisp interpreter and communicates with the Common Lisp acquisition system via serial port to coordinate precise timing of camera triggers and mirror angle control through DAC outputs.

# Hot Reloading and Interactive Development

The system implements two distinct approaches: true REPL-driven interactive development for Common Lisp components, and signal-triggered dynamic library reloading for C/C++ components. Both mechanisms preserve critical runtime state (camera connections, buffers, hardware control) across code updates, eliminating the need for process restarts during algorithm development.





This is code I use to control my holographic setup to image through
multimode fibers.

A significant part is a wrapper for the Aravis library to read out
multiple GigE Vision cameras.  The file dependencies are described in
arv.asd. I chose to use Clozure Common Lisp for this library because
it comes with a foreign function generator that can parse C header
files. To simplify development I added syntax completion for foreign
functions to slime.

Realtime control is done with an Arduino Due. To ease development (in
particular I don't like the long waiting time when uploading new code
to the Arduino) I ported femtolisp to this Arduino. This is sufficient
to generate the two DAC channels for my XY-scanning mirror and a bunch
of digital trigger signals for the cameras and a shutter.  See
arduino-femtolisp/. From Clozure Common Lisp I talk to the Arduino
using the code in arduino-serial-ccl/.

My main experiment is controlled from test.lisp. I also use the
binding for FFTW https://github.com/plops/cl-cffi-fftw3 to do Fourier
transforms.
