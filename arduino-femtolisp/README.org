This is a port of femto lisp, that can run on the Arduino Due.  I
added some code to access digital and analogue outputs and timing
functions of the Arduino from within Lisp.

This is my an Arduino Due board, that runs femtolisp. Some digital
ports are connected to synchronization inputs of three cameras and a
laser shutter. The board on the right provides an additional two
channel DAC that I use to drive an XY mirror.
